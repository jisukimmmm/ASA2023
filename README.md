## Introduction to Social Big Data for research
Description.
In this workshop, we focus on two sources of big data; online webpages and Twitter API with one of its aims to highlight advantages of such data. To be more specific, we will begin the workshop by getting familiar with the data format, methods of collecting the data, then on how to process data to extract interesting research ideas. We will also study how these two sources of big data have been useful in the research today with a more in depth focus on studies of international migration. Through this workshop session, we aim to get researchers in general to understand how to view the social world through large-scale data.
